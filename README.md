# Intima - Mutual Attention Networks

### This is a discontinued project from 2019 that I am releasing into the public domain - a novel idea to counter disinformation, digital addiction and loss of trust. TL;DR üëáüèΩ 

The basic idea - we are evolved for face-to-face communication in which we use *mutual attention* (e.g. through gaze üëÅ) to regulate / filter communication. This forms a "meta-network" that controls the flow of information. 

Digital networks inundate us with information without this meta-signalling and thus overwhelm our evolved #cognitive functions. This is the root of the plethora of problems that we are now encountering.

We need to retro-fit the attention economy to make it a "mutual-attention" economy.

In this paper I describe the model of mutual attention, propose a system design for implementing onto existing networks and propose some important use-cases.

I titled the nascent product as "Intima" in 2019 and worked on a PoC with @hutch120 but have now moved onto other work. 

I hope someone can see value in this idea and run with it. [I am particularly curious how this would intersect with decentralization in web3.]
